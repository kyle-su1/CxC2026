Critique Output: {'trust_score': 5.5, 'fake_review_likelihood': "Medium. Several reviews commend the keyboard's sound quality and feel, which is typical of marketing. The 'Customers are saying' snippets from Best Buy are particularly suspect, lacking specifics and potentially being curated. Also, many of the YouTube reviews contain affiliate links, so they are trying to make money off of you.", 'price_integrity': "Markup. The pricing is all over the place. Keychron CA lists multiple prices, some suspiciously low (like $61.99 CAD), suggesting possible bait-and-switch tactics or listing of barebone models without switches/keycaps. Other vendors like Best Buy Marketplace and Walmart.ca are significantly higher than Amazon and Keychron's own site, which could be third-party sellers marking up the price or simply outdated listings. The presence of numerous 'catalogid' entries in the price data suggests Google Shopping is struggling to aggregate consistent pricing information, which is never a good sign for the consumer.", 'hidden_flaws': ["Tom's Hardware review notes that the K2 HE is very similar to the cheaper K2 when the wooden panels are removed, suggesting you're paying a premium for aesthetics.", "SemiPro Tech+Gear YouTube review mentions 'minor issues' (check the timestamps in the description, cons are at 14:31), indicating potential problems not immediately apparent.", 'One Reddit user mentions wanting to replace their K2 HE, implying some level of dissatisfaction. Look for specific reasons in the linked threads.', 'The Rtings.com review lists a ton of competing models, which means there are a lot of alternatives to consider.']}
